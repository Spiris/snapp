Social Network App for AME 494 - AME 598 Fall 2013

Please see the Google Doc shared in class for the system design specifications (such as they are). Following are a few starting assumptions and general things to know.

* Ruby version 2.0

* Rails version 4.0.0

* Following good practice, the config/database.yml is not included as part of the git repository. Copy config/database.sample and rename it config/database.yml - at this time there shouldn't be any other changes needed.
